# Surgical Training Platform: Interactive 3D Visualization for Medical Education

## Overview

This repository presents a research-driven platform designed to enhance surgical education through interactive, photorealistic 3D visualization. Developed based on insights from our published study and user evaluation, the platform supports medical students, residents, and surgical professionals in learning complex procedures more effectively.

## About the Project

Building on our paper and comprehensive user study, we created a web-based **Surgical Training Portal** that demonstrates the capabilities of this advanced educational tool.

Within the portal, you can:

- **Watch real surgical videos** (e.g., Total Hip Arthroplasty)
- **Interact with 3D anatomical models** in a photorealistic environment
- **Navigate key points of interest**
- **Test your understanding** through integrated evaluation scenes

The current focus is on **Total Hip Surgery**, with future updates planned to include additional procedures.

## Key Findings

Our study demonstrated that:

- **Interactive 3D tools significantly outperform traditional 2D video** in teaching surgical procedures.
- **Residents and users with prior 3D experience** showed the greatest benefit.
- The platform enhances spatial understanding, engagement, and retention of surgical knowledge.

Evaluations were conducted with **dozens of medical students, residents, and senior surgeons**, validating the platform’s effectiveness.

## Try It

You can:

- [Try the demo (web version)](https://panteroni.github.io/3dsurgerytraining)  
- [Download the full executable](https://panteroni.github.io/3dsurgerytraining) for a complete local experience

> _Note: The demo is limited in features. The full version includes all interactions and evaluation tools._

## Features
